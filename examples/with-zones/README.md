# Using multiple zones

With Next.js you can use multiple apps as a single app using it's multi-zones feature.
This is an example showing how to use it.

In this example, we've two apps: 'home' and 'blog'. 
We also have a set of rules defined in `rules.json` for the proxy.

Now let's start two of our app using:

```
npm run home
npm run blog
```

Then start the proxy:

```
npm run proxy
```

Now you can visit http://localhost:9000 and access and develop both apps a single app.

### Proxy Rules

This is the place we define rules for our proxy. Here are the rules for this app:

```json
[
  {
    "pathname": "/blog(/**)",
    "zone": { "name": "blog", "url": "http://localhost:5000" }
  },
  {
    "pathname": "/**",
    "zone": { "name": "home", "url": "http://localhost:4000" }
  }
]
```

This is the place where how define different zones and how they should proxy. The name of the proxy is important and it'll be used in the client side.

## Special Notes

* A page with a same name should not be exists in multiple zones. If so, there'll be undefined behaviour in client side navigation.
    * According to the above example, a page named `blog` should not be exists in the `home` zone.
